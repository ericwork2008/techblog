# Binder cannot wake up the target process?

**CHATGPT always give wrong answer, I list here for an evidence**



in android binder API call, can kernel will wake up a process, if a bind call target to the process?ChatGPT

In Android's Binder framework, when a client makes a remote procedure call (RPC) to a service running in another process using the Binder API, the kernel does play a role in managing the communication between processes, but it doesn't directly "wake up" the target process in the sense of waking up a sleeping or idle process.  **is ChatGPT right???? I am confused by the answer.**

Here's how the process typically works:

1. **Client Process**: The client process initiates a Binder API call to a remote service. This call is typically synchronous, so the client may block while waiting for the response.
2. **Kernel**: The kernel manages the inter-process communication (IPC) between the client and server processes. It handles the low-level details of transferring data and control between processes.
3. **Server Process**: If the server process hosting the service is not already running, the kernel will start it as part of the Android system's process management. The kernel doesn't wake up a sleeping process directly; instead, it starts the process when needed based on the Android system's component lifecycle rules and service configuration.
4. **Service Handling**: Once the server process is running (or if it's already running), it handles the Binder API call from the client. The service processes the request and sends a response back to the client.
5. **Client Process**: The client receives the response from the service and continues its execution.

The Android system is responsible for managing the lifecycle of processes and services, including starting and stopping them as needed to conserve system resources. Processes can be in various states, including running, sleeping, or killed, and the system decides when to transition them between these states based on factors like user interaction and system resource constraints.

So, while the kernel and Android system play a role in managing processes and IPC, they don't directly wake up processes in response to Binder API calls. Instead, they start or stop processes as part of their overall process management strategy.
