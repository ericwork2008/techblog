# Android Power Management

## Power Managerment Architechture

(ChatGPT generated)

The Android power management system consists of several key components, including the kernel, power hal, power manager service, battery stats service, and the app framework.

1. The Linux kernel provides the core system services, including support for power management and device sleep states.
2. The power hal (Hardware Abstraction Layer) is a low-level interface that communicates with the device's hardware to manage power consumption. It provides information about the device's power state and allows the system to control power-related settings.
3. The power manager service is responsible for coordinating power management across the system, including controlling the device's sleep state and enforcing the power management policies set by the user and by the system.
4. The battery stats service collects and provides information about the device's battery usage, including the power consumption of individual apps and system components.
5. The app framework provides APIs for developers to optimize their apps for power efficiency, including access to information about the device's battery status, alarms and background services, and APIs for scheduling tasks.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive power management system that can dynamically adjust the device's power consumption based on user actions, app behavior, and system events.

1. Doze mode: This is a battery-saving feature that automatically restricts the background activity of apps when the device is unused for a certain period of time. This helps to conserve battery power when the device is not being used.
2. App Standby: This feature automatically identifies apps that are used infrequently and restricts their ability to access network and CPU resources. This helps to conserve battery power when the device is not being used.
3. Battery Saver mode: This is a user-initiated feature that reduces the device's performance and limits the use of background services to conserve battery power.
4. Background limits: Android sets limits on what apps can do in the background to reduce the amount of power they consume.
5. Wakelocks: This is a mechanism that controls the device's ability to enter and stay in a sleep state. Android can control wakelocks to prevent apps from keeping the device awake and consuming power.
6. Alarms and background services: Android provides APIs for scheduling alarms and background services that can run at specific times, even when the device is in a sleep state. These APIs can be used to conserve battery power by scheduling important tasks to run at specific times when the device is not being used.
7. Power-efficient hardware: The power management design is optimized for the specific hardware of each device, taking advantage of power-efficient components and features to reduce power consumption.
