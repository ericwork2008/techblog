# Linux VM parameter tuning

\
Tuning the virtual memory (VM) parameters of a Linux system can significantly impact performance, especially when dealing with resource-intensive workloads. Here are some common VM parameters you can tune and steps to follow to optimize performance:

**Disclaimer:** Make sure you have appropriate permissions and backup configurations before making changes to your system's settings. Incorrect configuration changes can lead to instability.

1. **Swappiness:**
   * Swappiness controls the degree to which the Linux kernel swaps out application memory to the swap space. Lower values (e.g., 10) make the kernel less likely to swap, which can be beneficial for systems with enough RAM.
   * To change swappiness temporarily: `sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10`
   * To make it permanent, add `vm.swappiness = 10` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a file in `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
2. **Cache Pressure:**
   * Cache pressure controls how aggressively the kernel reclaims pagecache and dentries. Lower values can reduce I/O activity.
   * To change cache pressure temporarily: `sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50`
   * To make it permanent, add `vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a file in `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
3. **Transparent Huge Pages (THP):**
   * THP can sometimes lead to performance issues. Disabling THP can be beneficial in some cases.
   * To disable THP temporarily: `echo never | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled`
   * To make it permanent, add the same line to a startup script or `/etc/rc.local`.
4. **Dirty Ratio and Dirty Background Ratio:**
   * These parameters control the amount of dirty (modified) data in RAM before the kernel starts writing data to disk.
   *   To change these ratios temporarily:

       ```bash
       bashCopy codesudo sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=10
       sudo sysctl vm.dirty_background_ratio=5
       ```
   * To make them permanent, add the lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a file in `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
5. **I/O Scheduler:**
   * The I/O scheduler can affect disk performance. Options include `noop`, `deadline`, and `cfq`.
   * You can change the scheduler for a specific block device using `echo sched_name > /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler`. To make it permanent, add the command to a startup script.
6. **Filesystem Tuning:**
   * Depending on your filesystem (e.g., ext4, xfs), you can tweak parameters for better performance. Refer to your filesystem's documentation.
7. **Swap Space:**
   * Ensure that your system has an appropriate amount of swap space. Having too much or too little can affect performance.
8. **Memory Management:**
   * Consider using `ulimit` or resource limits to control memory usage for specific processes.
9. **Monitoring:**
   * Use monitoring tools like `top`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, and `sar` to identify performance bottlenecks before and after making changes.

Remember that the impact of these changes can vary depending on your specific workload and hardware. It's essential to monitor system performance after making adjustments to ensure they have the desired effect and do not introduce new issues. Additionally, consider creating backups or snapshots of your system before making significant changes for easier recovery if something goes wrong.
