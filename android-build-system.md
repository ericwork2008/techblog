# Android Build system

In the Android build system, the macro functions are typically defined in the build script files under the `build/` directory of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source tree. These build script files are written in a specialized scripting language called "Make" and use the GNU Make build system.

Here are some of the key build script files under the `build/` directory that define macro functions:

1. `core/main.mk`: This file defines core macro functions and rules used by the Android build system. It includes functions related to building and packaging the Android framework, libraries, and executables.
2. `base_rules.mk`: This file defines common macro functions and build rules used by various modules in the Android build system. It includes functions related to compiling source code, generating intermediate files, linking binaries, and more.
3. `core/tasks.mk`: This file defines macro functions for defining and managing tasks in the Android build system. It includes functions related to task dependencies, task ordering, and task execution.
4. `build/make/core/config.mk`: This file contains macro functions and variables related to configuration options for the Android build system. It includes functions for setting compiler flags, linker flags, optimization options, and other build configuration settings.

These are just a few examples of the build script files in the `build/` directory of the Android source tree that define macro functions. The actual set of build script files and their contents may vary depending on the specific version of the Android source code you are working with.

It's important to note that the Android build system is complex, and modifying the build scripts requires a deep understanding of the build system's internals. Making changes to the build scripts should be done with caution, and it's recommended to consult the Android build documentation and the AOSP source code for more information on specific build functions and their usage.
