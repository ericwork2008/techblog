# How Android complain with old Version HAL

Android HIDL (Hardware Interface Definition Language) APIs are used for communication between Android system services and hardware components, such as device drivers, sensor modules, and other hardware-related functionalities. When changes are made to HIDL APIs in newer Android versions, there can be backward compatibility concerns with older versions. Here's how Android HIDL APIs can deal with backward compatibility:

1. **Versioning**: HIDL APIs often include version information to indicate which version of the interface is being used. This allows for backward compatibility by ensuring that older clients and newer servers or vice versa can communicate as long as they support a compatible version of the interface.
2. **Interface Evolution**: Android's HIDL specification allows for the evolution of interfaces over time. This means that new methods or properties can be added to an existing interface, and existing methods or properties can be deprecated. Deprecated elements will typically remain available for some time to provide backward compatibility, but developers are encouraged to migrate to the newer features.
3. **Optional Features**: Some HIDL interfaces may introduce optional features. Older clients may not support these optional features, but as long as they don't rely on them, they can continue to use the interface without issues. Newer clients can take advantage of the optional features if supported by the hardware.
4. **Version Checks**: When a client connects to a HIDL service, it can check the version of the interface to ensure compatibility. If the version is not supported, the client can gracefully handle the situation, perhaps by using alternative methods or disabling certain features.
5. **Compatibility Shims**: In some cases, compatibility shims may be provided to bridge the gap between different versions of the HIDL interface. These shims translate between the old and new versions to ensure communication remains possible.
6. **Vendor-Specific Extensions**: Hardware vendors often provide their own extensions and customizations to HIDL interfaces. These vendor-specific extensions may not be available in older versions of the hardware, so clients need to check for the existence of these extensions before using them.
7. **Documentation and Release Notes**: Android documentation and release notes typically provide information about changes to HIDL APIs. Developers should consult these resources when upgrading their applications or working with different Android versions.

It's important for developers to be aware of the versioning and compatibility mechanisms in HIDL interfaces and to design their applications to handle changes gracefully. This includes checking versions, handling deprecated methods, and providing fallback mechanisms when dealing with optional features or vendor-specific extensions. This approach helps ensure that Android applications can run on a wide range of devices with varying hardware and software configurations.
